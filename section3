def classes(students):
pass


## create function that sets max number of students of 30 in each class, and shows the amount of new classes needed based on number of students
def classes(students):
num = students // 30
max_num_of_students = if num % 30 != 0
new_classes = num // max_num_of_students


## add a condition that evenly distributes the students and add a condition that prioritises larger classes
students_two = students % num classes
allocation = [new_classes + 1] * students_two + [new_classes] * (num - students_two)


# create a dictionary for the display of the allocation of students


allocation_classes = {'Class {}': allocation[i] for i in range(num)}


print('Proposed allocation: Class{}.format(num)')
